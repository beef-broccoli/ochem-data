# ochem-data
This repo compiles published organic chemistry data, including raw data and calculated descriptor sets for molecules and reactions. 

## File structure: 

Each folder contains one reaction (see publication list for details). 

Every reaction folder was divided into two sub-folders: 
- `mols`: a list of molecules categorized by reaction roles)
- `rxns`: a list of reaction entries with multiple reaction components and yield). 

## Reading data directly from this repo

  ```Py
  import pandas as pd
  
  # change file path accordingly
  PATH = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beef-broccoli/ochem-data/main/deoxyF/paper-dft/train.csv'
  df = pd.read_csv(PATH)
  
  # do things with df...
  ```
  
Each subfolder (`ohe`, `mol2vec`, `mordred`...) includes different descriptor encodings for the list of molecules or reaction entries
